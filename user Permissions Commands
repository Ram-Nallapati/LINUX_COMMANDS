Here is a comprehensive list of Linux commands for managing user permissions that are particularly useful for an SDE (Software Development Engineer) role. 
These commands cover file and directory permissions, ownership, access control lists (ACLs), and special permission bits.



----------------  File and Directory Permission Commands --------------------------

View Permissions:
        ls -l
        Lists files and their permissions.


Change File Permissions (chmod):

        Using symbolic notation:
        chmod u+r file.txt    # Add read permission for the owner.
        chmod g-w file.txt    # Remove write permission for the group.
        chmod o+x file.txt    # Add execute permission for others.
        chmod u=rwx,g=rw,o=r file.txt  # Set specific permissions.


        Using numeric notation:
        chmod 755 file.txt    # rwxr-xr-x
        chmod 644 file.txt    # rw-r--r--



Recursive Permission Change:
        chmod -R 755 directory/
        Change Ownership (chown):


Change the owner of a file:
        chown new_owner file.txt


Change the owner and group:
        chown new_owner:new_group file.txt


Recursive ownership change:
        chown -R new_owner:new_group directory/



Change Group Ownership (chgrp):
        chgrp new_group file.txt



------ Access Control Lists (ACLs) ----------------------

Set ACL Permissions:
        setfacl -m u:username:rw file.txt  # Grant read and write to a specific user.
        setfacl -m g:groupname:r file.txt  # Grant read to a specific group.


View ACL Permissions:
        getfacl file.txt


Remove ACL Permissions:
        setfacl -x u:username file.txt  # Remove ACL for a user.
        setfacl -b file.txt             # Remove all ACLs from a file.


Set Default ACL for Directories:
        setfacl -d -m u:username:rw directory/


------------- Special Permission Bits --------------------


Set Sticky Bit (Prevents deletion by non-owners):
        chmod +t directory/


Set SUID (Set User ID):
        chmod u+s file
        Allows a file to be executed with the privileges of the file owner.



Set SGID (Set Group ID):
        chmod g+s directory/
        Ensures that new files in a directory inherit the group ownership.


------------------------ Checking and Managing Permissions ------------------------------

Check Effective User and Group:
        whoami       # Shows the current user.
        id -u        # Displays the user ID.
        id -g        # Displays the group ID.
        groups       # Shows the groups the current user belongs to.


Check File Information:
        stat file.txt


---------------- Test Permissions with su and sudo: ----------------------------

Switch user:
        su username

Execute as root:
        sudo command

Check Open File Permissions:
        lsof file.txt


--------------------- Working with User and Group Permissions ----------------------------------

Add a User to a Group:
        usermod -aG groupname username

List Users and Their Groups:
        getent group


------------------- Restrict File Access: ------------------------------------

Create a file accessible only by the owner:
        chmod 600 file.txt

Create a directory with restricted access:
        chmod 700 directory/


Temporary Elevated Permissions:
        sudo -u username command


------------------ Advanced Permissions Management --------------------

Restrict Execution:
        chmod a-x file.sh


Set Default Permissions (umask):
        umask 022  # Default permissions for newly created files and directories.

Audit File Access:
        auditctl -w /path/to/file -p war -k file_access
        ausearch -k file_access


------------------ Combining Commands  ------------------------------


Find Files with Specific Permissions:
        find /path -type f -perm 644


Bulk Change Permissions:
        find /path -type d -exec chmod 755 {} \;
        find /path -type f -exec chmod 644 {} \;

Remove Write Permissions for Others Across a Directory:
        chmod -R o-w directory/


Log Permission Changes:
        echo "chmod 644 file.txt" >> permission_changes.log
