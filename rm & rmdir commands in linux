The rm and rmdir commands in Linux are essential for file and directory management. Below is a comprehensive list of rm and rmdir commands tailored
to an SDE role, focusing on common use cases, advanced options, and safety practices:

------------------ rm Commands ---------------------------


------------Basic rm commands ---------------


Delete a single file:
        rm file_name


Delete multiple files:
        rm file1 file2 file3


Delete all files in a directory (not the directory itself):
        rm directory_name/*



Delete a directory and its contents recursively:
        rm -r directory_name


Delete files without prompting for confirmation:
        rm -f file_name


Forcefully delete a directory and its contents:
        rm -rf directory_name


Delete files interactively (ask for confirmation):
        rm -i file_name


Delete multiple files interactively:
        rm -i file1 file2 file3


Delete files with verbose output:
        rm -v file_name


Delete files matching a specific pattern:
        rm *.log


Delete files in subdirectories matching a pattern:
        rm **/*.log


Delete files older than 7 days:
        find . -type f -mtime +7 -exec rm {} \;


Delete files larger than 1MB:
        find . -type f -size +1M -exec rm {} \;


Create a dry run using ls to see files to be deleted:
        ls *.log


Move files to trash instead of deleting them directly (using trash-cli):
        trash-put file_name


Avoid accidental deletion using an alias for safety: Add this to ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc:
        alias rm='rm -i'
Then reload:
source ~/.bashrc



Delete all files except specific ones:
        find . -type f ! -name 'keep_this_file.txt' -exec rm {} \;



---------------  The rmdir command is used to remove empty directories. -------------------------------


------- Basic rmdir command -----------------

Remove an empty directory:
        rmdir directory_name


Remove multiple empty directories:
        rmdir dir1 dir2 dir3


--------------------- Advanced rmdir Usage -----------------------

Remove a directory and its parent directories if empty:
        rmdir -p parent_dir/sub_dir


Remove multiple nested directories (only if all are empty):
        rmdir parent_dir/{sub_dir1,sub_dir2}


---------------------------------
rm vs rmdir
Use rmdir for empty directories only.
Use rm -r for directories with contents.
------------------------




Delete empty directories recursively:
        find . -type d -empty -exec rmdir {} \;


Delete files first, then empty directories:
        find . -type f -exec rm {} \; -o -type d -empty -exec rmdir {} \;



----------------------------------
Scenarios for SDE Role
Codebase Cleanup
------------------------------------



Delete all .class files after compilation:
rm -rf build/*.class



Remove temporary files and logs in a project:
        rm -rf /path/to/project/tmp/*
        rm -rf /path/to/project/logs/*


--------------- Data Management -------------------------------

Delete old backup files:
        find /path/to/backups -type f -mtime +30 -exec rm {} \;


Clear cache directories:
        rm -rf ~/.cache/*
