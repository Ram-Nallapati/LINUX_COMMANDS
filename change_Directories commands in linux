-------------------Basic cd commands -----------------------------

cd [directory]: Change the current directory to the specified path.

Example: cd /home/user/Documents.
cd: Change to the user's home directory.

Equivalent to: cd ~.
cd ~: Navigate directly to the home directory.

cd -: Switch to the previous directory you were in


cd ..: Move up one directory (to the parent directory).
      Example: If you're in /home/user/Documents, cd .. moves to /home/user.

cd ../..: Move up two levels in the directory hierarchy.
      Example: From /home/user/Documents, cd ../.. moves to /home




---------------------------   Using Relative and Absolute Paths  ----------------------------

Relative Path: Use paths relative to your current directory.
      Example: cd folder/subfolder.

Absolute Path: Use the full path from the root directory.
      Example: cd /var/www/html.



------------------------   Working with Special Symbols ------------------------------------

cd ~username: Change to another user's home directory.
      Example: cd ~guest navigates to /home/guest.

cd ./: Stay in the current directory (does nothing).

cd /: Navigate to the root directory




---------------------------  Advanced Techniques  ------------------------

cd $(command): Use command substitution to navigate to directories dynamically.
      Example: cd $(pwd) navigates to the current directory (no effect).

cd $(dirname file_path): Change to the directory containing a specific file.
      Example: cd $(dirname /path/to/file.txt).

cd -P: Follow the physical directory structure, ignoring symbolic links.
      Example: If /home/user/link is a symlink to /var/log, cd -P /home/user/link takes you to /var/log.

cd -- [directory]: Use -- to handle directories with names that start with a hyphen (-).
      Example: cd -- -example-dir.




------------------------  Combining with Other Commands ----------------------------

pushd [directory]: Change directory and save the previous one on the stack.

popd: Return to the last directory saved by pushd.

pwd: Display the current working directory after using cd.

ls + cd: Combine to navigate and list directories.
      Example: ls /etc && cd /etc.


Aliases: Create shortcuts for common cd commands.
      Example: alias docs="cd ~/Documents".
